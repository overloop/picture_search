<p><b>Picture Search</b></p>
<p>It might help you to find pictures by color, so you can finally organize your collection of Konata's pictures, or maybe your photos, or find pronz on your friend's computer, I dunno. Add some folders to index, click ok and take a nap, come back and search all you want. You can start searching while index is building, but results will be limited to indexed files.
</p><p>Technical details: Picture Search index stored in database, two database system supported: <i>Mysql</i> and <i>Sqlite</i>. Mysql requires Mysql server, and it's quite faster, Sqlite is slightly slower, but doesn't require server. Choice is yours.
