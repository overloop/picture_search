<p><b>Picture Search</b></p><p>
It might help you to find pictures by color, so you can finally organize your collection of Konata's pictures, or maybe your photos, or find pronz on your friend's computer, I dunno. Add some folders to index, click ok and take a nap, come back and search all you want. You can start searching while index is building, but results will be limited to indexed files.
</p><p>
Technical details: Picture Search index stored in database, two database system supported: <i>Mysql</i> and <i>Sqlite</i>. <i>Mysql server</i> required in order to use mysql database, and it's quite faster, <i>Sqlite</i> is slightly slower, but no server required. Choice is yours.

<p>Picture Search is freeware.</p>
